## Before You Start — Read the License

DoScript is released under the **Server-Lab Open-Control License (SOCL) 1.0**.
By contributing, you agree that your changes fall under the same license.

Please read [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) before submitting anything. If you're not comfortable with the terms, reach out before contributing so we can talk it through.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repo

Hit the **Fork** button at the top of the [DoScript repository](https://github.com/TheServer-lab/DoScript) to create your own copy. This is where all your changes will live until they're ready to merge.

### 2. Make Your Changes

Clone your fork locally and make your changes:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DoScript.git
cd DoScript
```

A few guidelines to keep things clean:

- Keep changes focused — one fix or feature per PR is much easier to review than a giant mixed commit
- Follow the existing code style and naming conventions
- Test your changes before submitting — run a few `.do` scripts to make sure nothing is broken
- If you're adding a new feature, consider adding an example script to `/examples`

### 3. Leave Comments and Suggestions in `comments.txt`

Before opening your PR, add a note to **`comments.txt`** at the root of the repo. This is the place to:

- Explain *why* you made the change, not just what it does
- Flag anything you're unsure about or that needs a second opinion
- Leave suggestions for future improvements related to your change
- Note any known limitations or edge cases you didn't cover

There's no required format — just be clear and honest. Think of it as a conversation starter for the review.

### 4. Open a Pull Request

Push your changes to your fork and open a PR against the `main` branch:

- Give your PR a clear, descriptive title
- Write a short summary of what changed and why
- Reference any relevant issues if applicable

### 5. Merge!

Once your PR is reviewed and approved, it gets merged. That's it — you're a contributor! 🎉

## What to Contribute

Not sure where to start? Here are some ideas:

- **Bug fixes** — something behaving unexpectedly? Fix it and explain what was wrong in `comments.txt`
- **New examples** — real-world `.do` scripts that show off what DoScript can do
- **Docs improvements** — clearer explanations, better examples, typo fixes in `/learn`
- **Feature suggestions** — not sure how to implement it yourself? Open a PR that just adds your idea to `comments.txt` and we'll figure it out together

## Questions?

Open an issue or drop a note in `comments.txt` — we're friendly, we promise.
